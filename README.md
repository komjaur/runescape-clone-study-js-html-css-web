# RuneScape Web Game Prototype

This repository contains a minimal prototype for a RuneScape-like web game. Below is a list of potential skills grouped into categories.

## Skill System Demo

A very simple skill system is implemented in `RunescapeWebGame/js/main.js`. Click the **Train Attack** button on the web page to gain experience and watch the Attack level increase.

## Combat & Inventory Demo

The page also demonstrates a very small combat loop written in an object oriented style. Click **Attack Enemy** to fight a goblin. When the goblin is defeated it drops an item that appears in your inventory display.

## Adventure Demo

A very lightweight adventure system lets your hero automatically battle foes for a short time. Click **Go on Forest Adventure** and wait five seconds to see how many goblins or skeletons were defeated and what loot was gathered.
